# Gyoda Trip Plan for Anime/Game Fans (Mid-December)

## Main Destination: Everyday Gyoda (World's Best Crane Game Center)
*   **Name:** Everyday Gyoda (エブリデイ行田店)
*   **Appeal:** Guinness World Record holder for the number of crane games. A paradise for UFO catcher lovers.
*   **Address:** 644-1 Shimonin, Gyoda City, Saitama (埼玉県行田市下忍644-1)
*   **Opening Hours:**
    *   Weekdays: 12:00 - 22:00
    *   Saturday: 10:00 - 22:00
    *   Sunday: 10:00 - 22:00
*   **Note:** Check for special Year-End/New Year hours if visiting late in December.

## Nearby Attractions Check

### 1. Oshi Castle (忍城)
*   **Verdict:** **Recommended.**
*   **Distance:** Close (about 10-15 mins by car/bus from Everyday Gyoda).
*   **Appeal:** Reconstructed castle famous for the "Siege of Oshi" (floating castle). The movie "Nobo no Shiro" (The Floating Castle) was set here.
*   **Mid-December:** The castle grounds are a park (free), and the museum inside (fee required) is indoors, making it a good winter stop.
*   **For Young People:** Good for photos and learning about the "impregnable castle."

### 2. Sakitama Kofun Park (Sakitama Ancient Burial Mounds)
*   **Verdict:** **Conditional.**
*   **Appeal:** A park with 9 large keyhole-shaped burial mounds. A National Special Historic Site.
*   **Mid-December:** It is an open park. The "Karakaze" (dry winter wind) can be strong and cold.
*   **Advice:** If the weather is sunny and calm, it's a nice walk. If it's windy, visit the **Museum of the Sakitama Ancient Burial Mounds** instead to see the National Treasure "Inariyama Sword."

### 3. Retro Vending Machine Restaurant (Iron Vending Machine House / 鉄剣タロー)
*   **Verdict:** **CLOSED.**
*   **Status:** The famous "Auto Restaurant Tekken Taro" has unfortunately closed down (around 2020).
*   **Alternative:** For retro vibes, look for other "Auto Restaurants" in the wider Saitama/Gunma area, but the one in Gyoda is no longer available.

## Additional Recommendations for Young People (Mid-December)

### A. Ancient Lotus Park (Kodai Hasu no Sato) - Winter Illumination
*   **Why:** While the lotuses bloom in summer, the park hosts a massive **Illumination event** in winter (usually Dec-Jan).
*   **Appeal:** Great for dates or evening photos. The observation tower offers a view of the night lights (and rice paddy art in autumn, though harvested by Dec).
*   **Timing:** Evening (after sunset).

### B. Gyoda Tabi (Socks) & "Riku-ou" Spots
*   **Why:** Gyoda is famous for traditional "Tabi" socks. The hit TV drama "Riku-ou" (about a Tabi maker making running shoes) was filmed here.
*   **Activity:** Visit the **"Tabi and Lifestyle Museum"** or try a **Tabi Dyeing Experience** (reservation usually required) at "Makaba".
*   **Appeal:** Unique cultural experience, very "Instagrammable."

## Suggested Itinerary (Half-Day / Evening Focus)

1.  **14:00 - Everyday Gyoda**: Spend 2-3 hours playing crane games.
2.  **16:30 - Oshi Castle**: Visit for sunset photos. The castle looks cool in the twilight.
3.  **17:30 - Ancient Lotus Park**: Enjoy the Winter Illumination (if active) or head to a local restaurant.
    *   *Food:* Try **"Jelly Fry" (Zeny-furai)**, a local Gyoda snack (potato and okara croquette, no jelly involved!).
